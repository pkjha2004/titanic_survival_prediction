# Titanic Survival Prediction

This project predicts the survival of passengers on the Titanic using logistic regression. The dataset used for this project is the Titanic dataset, which contains information about the passengers.

## Introduction

The Titanic Survival Prediction project aims to build a machine learning model to predict whether a passenger survived the Titanic disaster based on various features such as age, sex, and fare. This project demonstrates data preprocessing, model training, and evaluation using logistic regression.

## Results

The logistic regression model achieved an accuracy rate of **81.18%** (0.8117977528089888).

## Installation and Usage

To get started, clone the repository, install the required dependencies, and run the provided Jupyter Notebook or Python script to see the data preprocessing, model training, and evaluation steps.

```sh
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/titanic-survival-prediction.git
cd titanic-survival-prediction
pip install -r requirements.txt
